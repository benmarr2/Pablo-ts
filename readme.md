# Pablo

Pablo is a Mario-like game that is written in typescript using the Phaser 3 framework. I submitted this as a university project for the advanced web development module of my computer science degree.  

`npm install`
`npm start`

NOTE: Movement feels bugged on Windows, it was written on linux. Need to investigate why.
